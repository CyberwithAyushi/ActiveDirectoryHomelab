# ActiveDirectoryHomelab
This project sets up an Active Directory (AD) home lab to simulate real-world cyber attacks and analyze security logs using Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. The lab provides hands-on experience in understanding how domain environments work, ingesting event data into a SIEM, and generating attack telemetry to enhance detection capabilities.
