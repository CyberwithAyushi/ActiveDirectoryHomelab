# ActiveDirectoryHomelab
This project sets up an Active Directory (AD) home lab to simulate real-world cyber attacks and analyze security logs using Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. The lab provides hands-on experience in understanding how domain environments work, ingesting event data into a SIEM, and generating attack telemetry to enhance detection capabilities.


# Key Features:
✅ Active Directory Setup – Configure a Windows domain environment for security testing.
✅ Splunk Integration – Collect and analyze logs from various sources for threat detection.
✅ Attack Simulation – Use Atomic Red Team to generate real-world attack scenarios.
✅ Brute Force Attack via RDP – Perform and detect unauthorized login attempts.

# Tools to be used:
VirtualBox (https://virtualbox.org) - virtual machine
•	Windows Server 2022 as the server with Active Directory
•	Kali Linux - attacker machine
•	Windows 10 Pro - target machine

Splunk (www.splunk.com) - SIEM tool
•	Splunk Universal Forwarder - log forwarder

Sysmon - log collection for Windows

Atomic Red Team (https://atomicredteam.io/) - a library of tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
