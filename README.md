# ActiveDirectoryHomelab
This project sets up an Active Directory (AD) home lab to simulate real-world cyber attacks and analyze security logs using Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. The lab provides hands-on experience in understanding how domain environments work, ingesting event data into a SIEM, and generating attack telemetry to enhance detection capabilities.



# Tools Used:
VirtualBox (https://virtualbox.org) - Virtual Machine

  •	Windows Server 2022 as the server with Active Directory

  •	Kali Linux - Attacker Machine

  •	Windows 10 Pro - Target Machine

  •	Ubuntu Server - Splunk Server

Splunk (www.splunk.com) - SIEM tool

 •	Splunk Universal Forwarder - Log Forwarder

Sysmon - Log collection for Windows

Atomic Red Team (https://atomicredteam.io/) - A library of tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.


This repository serves as a collection of documentations when creating cybersecurity homelabs, mainly focused in enhancing my SOC analyst skills and knowledge
